This assignment was an introduction to the pthread library.  It
implements a simple producer/consumer style problem.

The program creates two threads: one produces data and the other
consumes data.  The data being produced and consumed are random
integers in the range 0 to 99.

A total of 100 integers are produced.  After each integer is produced
there is a 50% chance for the producer to sleep for 1 second and 50%
chance it will sleep for 4 seconds.  After the consumer thread
consumes each integer it has a 50% chance of sleeping for 1 second and
50% chance of sleeping for 5 seconds.
